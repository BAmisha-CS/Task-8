# Task-8
Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.

üîê VPN Setup and Verification using https://protonvpn.com/ 
This task demonstrates the step-by-step process of installing and testing a VPN for IP masking and encrypted internet traffic. The free version of Proton VPN was used throughout the task. 

‚úÖ Step 1: Choose and Sign Up for a VPN
A free account was created with Proton VPN, a trusted, privacy-focused VPN provider based in Netherland and America. It offers unlimited bandwidth on its free plan and strong encryption standards without storing user activity logs.

‚úÖ Step 2: Download and Install the VPN Client
The Proton VPN client was downloaded from the official website and installed on the system. After installation, the application was launched and logged in using the registered account credentials. A screenshot showing the successful installation and app interface is included.

‚úÖ Step 3: Connect to a VPN Server
Using the Proton VPN app, a nearby free server was selected for optimal performance, and a connection was established. This rerouted all network traffic through the VPN tunnel, masking the real IP address.

‚úÖ Step 4: Verify IP Address Has Changed
To confirm the VPN was working, the site https://whatismyipaddress.com/ was used to check the public IP address before and after connecting to Proton VPN.
The original IP reflected the user‚Äôs actual location.
After connection, a new IP (matching the VPN server's location) appeared, confirming IP masking was successful.

‚úÖ Step 5: Confirm Traffic is Encrypted
Use a Secure Website (HTTPS)
While connected to Proton VPN, a browser was opened, and a secure HTTPS website was visited:
(https://www.wikipedia.org/)
The browser showed a padlock icon in the address bar, indicating that the website was served over HTTPS and that the traffic was encrypted during transmission. This confirms that the VPN is encrypting internet traffic properly.

‚úÖ Step 6: Disconnect VPN and Compare
After testing, the VPN was disconnected. The IP address was checked again using https://whatismyipaddress.com/ , and the original IP reappeared ‚Äî verifying that the VPN had fully disengaged. Web browsing speed and behavior were also compared before and after VPN usage.
